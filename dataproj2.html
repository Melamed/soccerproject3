      <h1>Top 20 selection mistakes made by top European soccer clubs  since 2011  (according to data)</h1>
		<h2>by Dmitry Melamed</h2>
</div>

		<p class ="textfour">Even though top soccer clubs usually have world-class scouting systems, they do sometimes make mistakes. If you ask regular soccer fans which transfers in European soccer were the biggest failures in their opinion, they would probably give you some names from this list. But I went further and decided to settle this question once and for all and give an answer using the most accurate method - data analysis.</p>
		<p class ="texttwo">For almost each player that got transferred to top European clubs since the 2011/2012 season I found out what was the transfer cost, managed to figure out what their approximate salary by September 2014 was and calculated their average rating for their respective clubs up until this point. Players who no longer play for the clubs, played less than 5 games, or got transferred just this winter are not on the list because it is either impossible to find all relevant data for them or because the statistics that are out there would not be a fair assessment of their actual level. </br>

        By calculating their mean deviation from the average rating(6,9) and salary(816 thousand pounds) among them I was able to determine a deviation factor that ultimately helped  me create this top 20. Enjoy! And Premier League fans get ready, the majority of players in this list are from English clubs.

Having played for the Blues in 44 competitive matches and scoring 11 goals, however, Andre stopped being part of Jose Mourinho's plans and was transferred to VfL Wolfsburg, which, with Kevin de Bruyne is becoming an asylum for talented players rejected by Chelsea.</h3></br>

It's hard to say which of the two forwards' careers has benefited more from this exchange - Giampaolo is still warming the bench at San Siro and earning ridiculous amounts of money for it, while Antonio is clearly finishing his career in Parma (and is currently not on this list).</p></br>

"I will give my all every time I play and I'm looking forward to many happy years in Manchester", he said upon being revealed as The Citizens' new signing. Well, according to data, Fernando, you are not giving your all.</p></br>

So far, that has been the highest amount paid by any club for a Spanish player. The data shows that los Merengues could have clearly spent this money better. </p></br>

Being paid for no money at all, Fernando showed quality game at Juventus Stadium in the first season, even scroring twice against Real Madrid in the Champions League, before becoming a complete shadow of his former self in the second season for the club. It is becoming even more complicated for Llorente now, as another Spanish international, Alvaro Morata, is showing a much more consistent game for the <i>vecchia signora</i>.

While playing for Fiorentina, Jovetic was among the most prospective young players of the continent, at Manchester he didn't even appear 30 times on the field during the course of two years. Maybe Man City is just not for Montenegrin players. Does Jo-Jo's story sound familiar to you, Stefan Savic?</p></br>

If this rating included years before 2011, Andy Caroll would definitely be among these players. Having sold probably the best player in the Red's modern history, Luis Suarez, to Barcelona, they have spent all the money they made on bringing players like Markovic to Anfield, who, (while not being a bad player) is not playing even half as good as he did at Benfica. But the real gem of this list and, probably, the biggest fail made by Liverpool in the last few years is much higher on this list. You know who I am talking about, don't you?</p></br>

Sure, sounds like Man Utd. After failed attempts on raising world-class players from Alexander Buttner and Wilfred Zaha (who was not even given a chance), Shaw sounded like a fresh start. To be honest, Luke is not that bad. But clearly not as good as the money that was paid for him and his salary. Why did you even have to get rid of Patrice Evra in the first place, United?</p></br>

Be mad at the data. Honestly, this is by far the most surprising position in this rating. But you've got to admit - no matter how good Didier was, he IS getting older. Three goals in 24 appearances, even though in some matches he hardly played for more than ten minutes. Of course, he got transferred for free and his leader qualities are something the stats can't show - but this data shows that in terms of performance on the field, the King is just not as good as you were hoping he would be when he came back.</p></br>

Before that he even got an invitation to the English national team and already played 13 matches for it, including three FIFA World Cup-2014 fixtures. With the stats like these, I don't really think he would get called up again. Oh, wait.. what am I talking about? It's the English national team, of course he would.</p></br>

Why buy one of the best (at that time) defensive midfielders in the world and immediately put him on the bench? In 2012, it looked like Song had a very impressive career ahead of him, but Tito Villanova clearly thought otherwise. Having made around 30 appearances for the Blaugrana (most of them not in the starting 11), Alex finally decided to try and revive his career by a loan spell in West Ham. Too little too late, maybe?</p></br>

A lot has been said about Mario's fantastic talent in the last few years. Almost as much has been said about his laziness and unprofessionalism. The prodigal golden boy of modern soccer continues to disappoint in every team he plays for, reaching the "peak" at Liverpool, scoring only two goals for the club during the course of the season. Which club will be next to step on the same rake again and sign the fallen striker? </p></br>

As of late, experts are even starting to say that the English winger is finally starting to become a player Manchester bosses always wanted him to be. But over the course of four seasons, on average, Young struggled to live up to fans expectations and a ridiculously big salary for a player of his level.</p></br>

Remy is definitely not a bad player and during his little time on the field for the Blues he didn't really have the chance to impress. Loic is definitely not Schevchenko or Ballack. He is not even Torres or Cuadrado either, but the transfer to Chelsea has not been beneficial to his career by any means, that's for sure.</p></br>

Since his arrival at Paris, Yohan has not been the same. Not playing as much as during his spell for the Magpies (presence of Marco Veratti and Tiago Motta in PSG midfield may have been the cause of that), when he eventually gets a chance to play, Cabaye's performances are very bleak. What is it with moneybag clubs ruining careers of potential soccer stars?</p></br>

I am sure that 7 goals in almost 50 games is not something Daniel Levy expected from the Spanish striker when he signed him for his team. Currently, Soldado has completely lost his spot in the Tottenham starting line-up, and the emergence of brilliant Harry Kane is definitely not helping the situation. Maybe a spell somewhere back home in Spain could help put Roberto's career back on tracks? </p></br>

Not only his rating is probably among the worst in Europe, he is still earning a pretty impressive salary of more than 1.2 million pounds. Having enjoyed loan spells at different clubs over the course of the last four years, including Juventus, Boriello has truly made a name for himself. And sadly, that name sounds bad. But you gotta admit it, this guy is talented at least in one thing - making superstar wages while clearly not being a superstar. Marco, teach me how to do it, please!</p></br>

Technically, he officially joined Milan in Jan 2015, having played for Rossoneri on a loan six months before that, but they DID BUY him, so there was no chance I would miss the opportunity to include Fernando in this list. I don't know what is Galliani's grand scheme, but immediately after paying a sum for the player, Milan loaned him out to Atletico Madrid, where he started his career many years ago. And, to be honest, Torres is not doing that bad there. Only he is too old now to be spotted by Liverpool once again and become a player we all knew and loved one day. Or is he not?</p></br>

As data shows, Radamel Falcao's transfer to Monaco and loan spell to Man Utd are the top two biggest selection failures made by top clubs in the last four years. A good excuse for Man Utd is that they didn't buy him yet. A bad excuse for them is that they are paying him a salary of 275 thousand pounds a month, which totals to a ridiculous 3.3 million pounds a year. Not to shabby for a reserve team player, huh? His performance at Monaco is however, a surprise indeed. When creating this data set, I expected the Colombian's season at the Ligue 1 club to be in the list, but not this high. All in all, we should all feel sorry for this guy (even if you are a United hater). He used to be a fantastic player two years ago but something is not going well since that fateful knee injury. But, for sure, modern soccer would benefit if Falcao will once again return to his true level. Let's hope that happens soon.
